The Selfish Giant English Summary
The story begins with the children playing in the Giant's garden every afternoon after arriving from school. The garden was beautiful, large, with soft grass and fruit trees. The trees bore rich fruit and the birds sang sweetly sitting on them.

One day after seven years, the giant returned. He was staying with his friend, the Cornish Ogre. The children were afraid to see him. He saw the children playing and said that he would not allow anyone to play here as it was his own garden. He built a wall around it and also put up a bulletin board. The bulletin board displayed a warning: "Trespassers will be prosecuted."

The children were sad because they had no other place to play. They would wander the high garden walls and remember the beautiful garden within them.

Spring season arrived and there were flowers and little birds everywhere. But it was winter in the giant's garden and there were frost and snow. In the absence of children, the birds did not sing either. Once a flower sprouted from the grass, but after seeing the bulletin board, he also fell asleep again. Then came the north wind and the hail storm. Due to the giant's selfishness, the golden fruits of autumn also did not reach his garden.


Then one morning the giant detected sweet and wonderful music. It was a linnet singing outside his window. The hail and north wind stopped and he could feel spring. He saw the children entering his garden through a small hole. The children were sitting on the tree branches and the trees were blooming. He also saw the birds fly and heard them chirp. The flowers had also risen.

But, to his surprise, winter was still in one corner. He saw that a boy was standing there and he could not reach the branches of the trees. The tree lowered its branches but still, it couldn't climb.

In this scene, his heart melted. He realized that he was actually very selfish. He decided to put that boy on the top of the tree, tear down the walls, and allow the children to play here forever. But when the children saw it, they fled and the garden was winter again. However, that child did not run while crying. The giant put it on the top of the tree and the tree immediately blossomed. He kissed the giant.


The other children came back to realize that the giant is not evil. Spring returned with them. The giant used to play with the children every afternoon, but that child was nowhere to be found. Over the years, it became very weak. One winter morning, he saw a beautiful tree with white flowers in the corner. The branches of the tree were golden and the boy stood underneath.

The boy was injured, which greatly enraged the giant. He told the boy that he would kill the man who had hurt him. The boy told him that these were the wounds of love. The boy smiled and asked the giant to come to his garden. Later, the children found the dead giant under the tree covered in white flowers.

    'author': "Edgar Allan Poe ",
    'title': "The Oval Potrait",
    'data': """ Summary:
'The Oval Portrait' (1842) is one of Edgar Allan Poe's shortest stories. Through the narrator's encounter with an oval portrait of a young woman in an Apennine chateau, he tells a powerful story about the relationship between art and life in just a few pages. Because of the way Poe presents his story as a subtle commentary on the relationship between life and art, the story merits close examination.

The wounded and delirious narrator has sought refuge in an old mansion with his valet or manservant, Pedro. He retreats to one of the rooms, where he contemplates the strange paintings adorning the walls and reads a small book he discovered on the bed's pillow, which contains information about the paintings. Around midnight, he adjusts the candelabrum in the room, and his gaze is drawn to a portrait in an oval-shaped frame, depicting a young girl on the verge of womanhood. The narrator is captivated by this life-like portrait, but he is soon repulsed by it.


He opens the book and reads the entry about the oval portrait's history. The woman depicted in it was the painter's young bride, and she was a perfect wife in every way – except that she was jealous of her husband's art, which distracted him from her. The artist paints a portrait of his wife and becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing her likeness until he spends all of his time staring at the portrait and very little time looking at her. She becomes weaker and weaker, depressed from losing her husband's love as he stops paying attention to her and Poe-oval-portrait-illustration becomes increasingly preoccupied with the painting. When he has nearly finished the portrait and turns to look at his wife, he discovers that she has died.

What distinguishes Edgar Allan Poe's stories from other gripping Gothic horror tales or unsettling stories is the way he depicts a central idea that the story explores and analyzes. 'The Oval Portrait' is a great example of this: it's clearly a story about the uneasy relationship between life and art, as embodied by the young bride and the oval portrait her artist-husband paints of her. But it's harder to pin down exactly what the story is saying about the connection between life and art.

However, given the story's ending – when the bride dies, ironically just after her husband has finished her portrait, with the cry, 'This is indeed Life itself!' – it appears possible to posit an analysis of 'The Oval Portrait' that sees the story as a warning about the dangers of ignoring reality in the pursuit of great art. When the artist loses sight of reality – embodied in the story by his devoted, but increasingly frail, wife – and becomes engrossed in art itself, he commits a fatal error.


Alternatively, we could view the story as less of a "moralizing" tale and more of a simple exploration of how things are. In this interpretation, the story may be seen not as a cautionary tale about the dangers of prioritizing art over life, but rather as a statement about the nature of creativity – namely, that no great art has ever been created without cost. After all, the oval portrait is an artistic success – it is its lifelike quality, as well as the artist's triumph in capturing the living essence of his subject, that draws the narrator's attention to it among all the other paintings.

Furthermore, there is no moral framework for the story's conclusion, no follow-up paragraph informing us that the story is warning us of the dangers of art – the oval portrait may have an oval-shaped frame, but 'The Oval Portrait' does not come with a handy framing that directs us to the story's meaning,' despite the fact that it is a framed or embedded narrative in the sense of having a text placed wit, However, the story ends without returning to hear the narrator's thoughts on what he has just learned.

The Chateau which we find here in this story is completely deserted and very old fashioned. The setting inside and outside seem very terrible. The apartments inside Chateau are so unmanaged and dirty. The apartment where the narrator and his valet stay have many things for decoration but all of them are in decaying state. The life-like portrait has been placed in one of the dark corners. The surrounding of the life-like portrait is so disturbing due to the unmanaged condition everywhere.

➜ The frame narrative is a literary technique that reveals about a story within a story. It starts with a different plot and setting of story but later immerses out with the next story within it. Here, this technique reveals us how a single story involves the next story within it. The story starts with different information about the narrator and his valet with a different setting.

➜ I don't think there is life in art. Art is just a creation to display which has meanings related to different things. But, in a literal sense, artists create life in art. They try to find out life within the art.



b. As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. Explain.

➜ This statement is absolutely right about painting. Painting is really a very admirable form of art. The painters really work hard to create quality paintings with meanings.

He feels completely puzzled to see that painting. He wants to know about its and painter.


c. A more intense look at the painting reveals the illusion. Have you noticed any such painting?

➜ Yes, I have noticed such painting. The painting becomes more meaningful when it is watched by the viewer who is passionate about paintings.

I tried a lot to grasp its meaning but vain. Later on, I got its meaning from my friend.

Main Summary:
In the very first scene, we find an unnamed child looking at his kneecap's scab. He was sitting alone on his front door's stairs. He had an old cut on his kneecap and its scab was brown. He bent forward to examine it closely.



After pondering much, he decided to pick that scab from his wound. He picked his scab gently with his nail and put it on his thigh. He rubbed his wound's circle and flipped the scab with his finger. 



The scab fell upon the edge of the red carpet. When he moved near the scab, different colours of the carpet attracted his attention. He imagined different things in those colours of carpet. He creatively imagined a game plan using different colours of the carpet. In his imagination, he supposed the red coloured spots as the lump of coals, that could burn him. The black coloured spots were the poisonous snakes, that could bite him and leave him to die. The yellow coloured spots were only the safe zones for him where he could step and cross the huge carpet to get inside. If he could get inside, he would be gifted a puppy for his birthday. 


The child imagined very tough and terrible game plan to reach his goal (The Wish of completing his game and getting a puppy). The child started to move ahead in his imaginative game. He moved ahead stepping on the yellow coloured spots only. He kept on moving ahead very carefully stepping o the safe zone (Yellow colour). 



As he reached the halfway across, he started to wobble around. He balanced his body by waving his arms. He didn't get a proper step ahead. He started to panic because there was no turning back due to his body position. The black coloured spots (Poisonous Snakes) ahead made him so panic. 



He remained there on the yellow safe zone for a long time. He waited and thought about the possible ways to move ahead. The fear of not getting the puppy compelled him to continue his way ahead. He made proper use of his mind, paused himself and stepped further quite carefully. 



Just a step ahead of the halfway, the child had to make a decision. He had to choose an option whether to move on the left or the right. 


The left side was more difficult for him to step, but there were less black spots there. So he decided to move ahead using the left side. 



He took his next step on the yellow spot. He happened to touch the black spot which was a centimetre close. He felt so panic because he was nearly going to be bitten by a snake. But his luck saved him.



Again he had an option to choose. He could have gone right but he went left instead because he feared about black poisonous snakes. 



In his imagination, the snake looked up to see if he touched it or not. In a very panic tone, the child said, "I'm not touching you! You mustn't bite me! You know I'm not touching you!"


He continued his journey ahead. His next step was quite far. He decided to step slowly over. But when he jumped ahead, his feet fell on the spots so wide. He tried to get back but couldn't. He tried to shift all his weight to his front foot, but he couldn't. He was properly stuck. 



The snakes started stirring underneath his feet. He started to wobble being panic. He tried to balance himself by waving his arms however it didn't work. He slowly started to fall towards the black. He gave a loud cry as he touched the black. His mother was looking for him far behind the house outside in the sunshine.

      Civil Peace by Chinua Achebe Summary (Theme of the story)

This realistic short story "Civil Peace" has been written by a Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe. This story has presented the effects of the Nigerian Civil War on the people and also the 'Civil Peace' that followed. This story has presented the setting of Civil Peace in Eastern Nigeria after the Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970). The Nigerian Civil War lasted for three years. Within those years, nearly millions died due to starvation.
This short story is about a Nigerian family who lived in Enugu, a place in Eastern Nigeria. This family had experienced the devastated Nigerian Civil War. The main character of this story is Jonathan Lwegbu, who is an optimistic person.


Main Summary:

The main character Jonathan Lwegbu considered himself extraordinarily lucky. The miracle in his life was that he had come out of the war with five inestimable blessings. He, his wife, Maria, and three of their four children were alive. All of the five heads were safe in his family. The next miracle in his life as a bonus was his old bicycle which he got in fine condition after the war. When miracles took place in his life, he used to utter a phrase in wonder "Nothing puzzles God". He almost lost his bicycle during the war, when an army officer attempted to commandeer it. Sensing a "certain lack of grip and firmness in his manner," Jonathan guessed that the officer might a bribe in exchange for the bicycle. He saved his bicycle providing 2 pounds to the officer. After that, he buried his bicycle. After taking his bicycle out of the ground, started using his bicycle as a taxi. Within two weeks, he earned £115 through his taxi service.

Jonathan then travelled to Enugu, the capital city, in search of his house. He became quite surprised and delighted to find his house still standing, even though some nearby structures were reduced to a pile of rubble from the war. He examined his house and concluded that his house needed some repairs. So Jonathan immediately collected available materials: zinc, wood, and cardboard. He hired a carpenter to complete the housework.


After the completion of the repair, he moved his family members back home.

After their settlement, the entire family members worked hard to earn money and restore their lives. The children picked mangoes and Maria made Akara balls to sell in the neighbourhood. Jonathan used to work in the mines before the war. But when he realized that he couldn't regain his job as a coal miner, Jonathan opened up a bar for the soldiers, which he ran out of his home. Jonathan was thankful to God that he had family members, a home and a job.

Facing a lot of hardships, Jonathan's family did well, and then they even got a bonus from the government. The government started handing out egg rashers payments of twenty pounds in exchange for the Biafran money Nigerians turned over to the government's treasury. Jonathan left office with his money in his pocket. He was quite worried about the thieves on his way home. At home that evening, Jonathan became restless and couldn't get to sleep late at night. Finally, when he slept, he was awakened by a violent knock on the front door. He called out to ask who is knocking, and the reply came from the thieves. 


Jonathan's family called out for help from the police and the neighbours but no one came there to help them. Eventually, they stopped calling. The thieves called out then, repeating the families pleas for help. Jonathan and his family were in terror. The children and Maria were crying, Jonathan was groaning. The leader of the thieves spoke again, mockingly asking if he should call soldiers for help, but Jonathan said not to do so. The leader of the thieves demanded £100. They warned Jonathan to enter inside his house. Jonathan related his real condition to them. The voice trailed off, and a volley of automatic rifle fire burst through the air. Maria and the children started crying again. The leader told them not to cry. They just wanted some money and then they would go away.

Jonathan informed them about the money which he had got from the egg rasher. He even informed them that he didn't have £100. He swore about having a total amount of 20 pounds in his house. The thieves agreed to accept that money. Some of the thieves mumbled that he had more money and they should move inside and look, the leader told them to shut up. Jonathan went to get the twenty pounds out of his locked box to give to the thieves. The thieves moved away from there after receiving the amount from Jonathan through the window. The next morning, the neighbours came over to commiserate with Jonathan, but his family wasn't at home. They were at their day's work. Jonathan told his sympathizers that the loss of 20 pounds is nothing; the week before he did not have the egg-rasher money, and he didn't want to depend on it. The money went on easily from his hands, as did many other things in the war.

People had to face various problems during that time.  The government's law during that time was good.  There were many risks in people's life.  Thieves Used To Loot and Beat people without having any fear of law.  Though the Civil piece prevailed there, there was Anarchy everywhere.



b. What kind of attitude towards life do you think you would have if your situation was similar to that of Jonathan’s?

➜ I would be Optimist, hopeful and ready to face all the challenges.  I would be helpful to every people.  I would follow the right path, take the right decision, believe in God and many more...


c. Draw the character sketch of Jonathan Iwegbu.

➜ Jonathan is quite an optimistic person who has been faith in God. He always utters a line in the name of god saying that " Nothing puzzles God".  He becomes quite delighted to find miracles in his life. He never lives in disparity. He is a hardworking person who thinks positively for everyone. He loves his family members much.  At the time of hardship, he tries to save his family first.  During the time of civil peace, he works so hard to restore his life and his family.  His wife and his kids also work so hard to support him.  He really enjoys his present, giving value to his relative as well as his belongings.   He never regrets his loss. He starts the taxi service, repairs his house, opens a bar for soldiers to support his family.

 As an optimistic person,  he doesn't regret losing his 20 Pounds which he had got as a favour from the government.

 Hence,  Jonathan Iwegbu was the protagonist Central character of the story.  He was an ex-miner who was very labourers, and resourceful. He was also the responsible head of the family to inspire his family with optimism.

➜ No, It is not good to have a conflict between friendship and love because these are the relationships which are very essential for an individual. True friends and loved ones always care for each other. They shed light on your qualities, both positive and bad, and improve self-esteem. Via laughter and good times, friends help relieve tension and hardship. They will help you move forward.

As long as your love and intension are pure towards the person, it is not morally bad for two-person having the same feelings for the third one. Knowingly or Unknowingly, this type of condition may arise in a person's life. Although it is not bad, possibilities are high for the problems to arise in the near future. So, the only solution is to talk with each other and solve the problem by controlling your emotions.

      Poet Introduction:

Vishnu S Rai (1951) was educated in India, Nepal, and The UK. He taught English at Tribhuvan University for three decades and retired as Professor of English Language Education. Rai writes both in English and Nepali. He has written stories, Martyrs, & Other Stories (English), play Realities (English), travelogues Nau Dandapari (Nepali), and a novel Paheli (Nepali). But above all, he is a poet and he has published Sudama (a semi epic in Nepali), Jeevan (a collection of poems in Nepali), Vagabond Verses (a collection of poems in English), and Tritiyaki Joon (a collection of songs and gazals in Nepali, and his English poems are taught in Nepal and abroad. Rai is known as a poet of human emotions. The poem, Corona Says, written on the theme of the present world crisis Corona and its devastating impact on human life is a subtle satire on man's conduct and attitude. It views Covid 19 as the byproduct of man's treatment of nature.


Summary of the Poem:
Short Summary:
In this short poem, we find Corona speaking to humans. It denies wrongdoing that it is responsible for the death of thousands of people (corona positive) and the destruction of the world economy.

It didn't come alone. This is the result of human behaviour that is irrational and irresponsible of nature. Humans consider themselves to be the owners of the entire earth and all living and non-living things. They always use it according to their wish. They forget that the earth is a common habitat for all living things.

During the lockdown, when all human activity came to a halt, nature regained its old appearance: blue skies, pollution-free atmosphere, etc. It also shows that we are responsible for calamities (any event that causes great damage) and misery. motherland.

Finally, Corona warns that if we don't improve ourselves, more devastating pandemics will come, with more death and destruction.
Summary:
 Since the title of the poem is clear, here we find Corona saying something to humans. The name Corona needs no introduction. Even a child has heard of it. This pandemic has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people around the world.

This poem is the speaker's outlook (point of view) of the whole event. The speaker (corona) rejects the blame and says that it is not, but the humans are responsible for such great destruction. It did not come alone but was brought here by humans.

In fact, it was invited. Corona, (like other pandemics), is the result of human behaviour and activities that are not responsible for nature.

Here the speaker shows a mirror to humans. Humans believe that they are the kings of creation and the rulers of the entire earth. They think that all creation and other aspects of nature are their slaves, which they can use as they please. But that's not it.


Then the poet shows another side of the situation. In the long lockdown period, almost all human activities have stopped. Motherland rested a little. And nature has returned to its original state: blue skies and a pollution-free atmosphere. That is a positive aspect of the corona period. It also shows that if we (humans) don't abuse nature, it will calm down again.

Earth does not belong to only humans. It must be shared equally by all living things.

In the end, the speaker warned humans. Without a doubt, Corona will come back one day if we don't change our irresponsible attitudes and behaviour towards nature, more pandemics of this type will visit Earth.

Not only that, but such behaviour will eventually take us back to prehistoric times when people used to live in caves and had to hunt for food.

In the second and third stanza we find the use of hyperbole where the speaker claimed, " And I will love thee still my dear, Till a' the seas gang dry" " And the rocks melt wi' the sun!", "While the sands o' life shall run." Here, the speaker seems to be exaggerating his emotions in these lines to illustrate his desire to love her forever. The last two lines, " And I will come again, my love, Tho' it were ten thousand mile!" The speaker exaggerates the distance to demonstrate his firm love feelings.

f. What is refrain? Why is it used in the poem? Explain citing an example from the poem.
➜ Refrain is a poetic device in poetry that focuses only on repeated lines at a certain distance. It is used to emphasize something and to produce rhythm in the poem as well. It is used to break up stanzas. We find a refrain here in this poem in the second, third, and fourth stanzas.
The refrain in the poem are as follows:
And I will love thee still, my dear,
Till a' the seas gang dry.
And fare thee weel

a. What kind of love is expressed in "A Red, Red Rose"? 
➜ The poet shared his romantic love for his beloved in this poem, A Red, Red Rose, where his feelings are so profound. He compared his beloved with a fresh and beautiful July rose and a sweet melody as well. He also made several promises to always love his beloved.

b. Do you think that love has power? Why do the poets compose poems addressing their beloved?
➜ Yeah, I agree that love has authority. Love may also lead people to perfection, where harmful consequences can also be achieved. Poets are so enthusiastic about their creations, I think. Most poets in the world tend to write about the bond of love. Many poets write their poems addressing their loved ones because they want to write their own love experiences and share them with others. Their own love experience gives them support to build the best they can.
c. Poetry is the expression of feeling and emotions. Explain
➜ Poetry is the representation of thoughts and feelings that enables people to express themselves in writing. Poetry is a perfect way to relieve emotions, practice imagination, and exchange ideas and thoughts with others. Writing poetry in just a few words is an art, a way of communicating and seeking meaning. A melody of passion that flows through the pages, words that flow into each other and still convey the innermost feelings and emotions of those who read the words. Via a few lines of verse, poets can readily express their inner thoughts and emotions. The poets' works have a profound sense of human thoughts and emotions. The poetic lines create incredible definitions of the feeling of man. """

  The poem "All the World's a Stage" is written by the renowned poet William Shakespeare and is taken from his play "As You Like It." The poem is also known as "The Seven Ages Of Man."
The poem contains no rhyme scheme. This type of poem is known as free verse. This poem employs the following figures of speech: inversion, alliteration, onomatopoeia, metaphor, repetition, personification, and simile.

The poet describes the seven ages of life by comparing the world to a stage and each of us to actors on that stage of life. There are seven distinct stages or acts namely infancy, childhood, adolescence, youth, middle age, old age, and dotage. When we are born, we enter the stage, and when we die, we exit. The poem emphasizes the fleeting nature of life and the futility of man's efforts to amass wealth and fame because we leave this world empty-handed and as helpless as we entered it. As a result, accepting life as it comes and playing our roles to the best of our abilities is the key to living a contented and happy life. The poem teaches us to appreciate and enjoy every stage and moment of our lives, and to make the most of what we have.


The poet narrates the seven ages of life by comparing the world to a stage and each one of us to actors playing an individual role on that stage of life. Our entrance is our birth and our exit is our death In a lifetime, each one of us plays many parts and each part is compared to an act in a play. 

The first stage is that of an infant who cries. vomiting milk on the nurse's arms. 

In the second stage,  as a schoolboy, he drags himself unwillingly to school. 

In the third stage. man as a lover, sighs in separation and writes poems about his beloved beauty. 

As a soldier, in the fourth stage, he is ready to take strange oaths. The poet compares him to a fierce leopard who is jealous Of others' honour and is very quick to quarrel. He is ready to risk his life for a short-lived reputation by jumping in front of a cannon. 

The fifth stage is the justice stage, well-fed with chicken. His appearance is formal and he looks mature. He uses wise sayings, proverbs and examples from the modern age. This is where he has reached middle age and gained maturity. 


Old age is the sixth stage of a man's life, where he wears pantaloons and slippers on his feet. He is now thin, lean and weak, and his eyesight too has become weak. His manly voice has turned into the shrill voice of a child. Where he speaks it appears as if he were playing upon a pipe or as if he were whistling (due to gaps in his teeth some of which have fallen out). 

The last stage of man's life is dotage. In this stage, he is somewhat senile, completely dependent on others and helpless like a child as he is now nearing death. This is the stage of second childhood, as like a child, at this stage a man needs help with everything. He loses his teeth. eyesight and taste and becomes forgetful. This completes his part in the play of life, as after this he leaves the stage, or in other words, he dies.""",

a. Describe the various stages of human life picturised in the poem "All the world's a stage."


➜ According to Shakespeare, the world is a stage and everyone is a player. He says that every man has seven stages during his lifetime. He performs different seven roles in his lifetime and finally exits from this worldly stage. The first stage of a man is childhood. He plays in the arms of his mother. He often vomits and cries in this stage. In his second stage, the man is an unwilling school going, student. He becomes a lover in his third stage. He is very busy composing ballads for his beloved and yearns for her attention. In the fourth stage, he is aggressive and ambitious. He seeks reputation in all what he does. He is ready to guard his country and becomes a soldier. In his fifth stage, he becomes a fair judge with maturity and wisdom. In the sixth stage, he is seen with loose pantaloons and spectacles. His manly voice changes into a childish treble. The last stage of all is his second childhood. Slowly, he loses his faculties of sight, hearing, smell and taste and exits from the roles of his life. Thus, Shakespeare has presented the pictures of the seven stages of a man's life in the poem 'All the World's a Stage'. 

b. Is Shakespeare's comparison of human's life with a drama stage apt? How?

➜ Yes, Shakespeare's comparison of a human's life with a drama stage apt. He compares the whole world with a stage where men and women are only actors. In a drama, every player enters the stage, acts his/her part and then exits. In the same way, we enter this world by birth. We lead our life in different characters. We exit from this world at the time of our death. Shakespeare says that every man has seven stages during his lifetime. His opinion related to life is quite right. Players or people come into this worldly stage and perform their seven different roles and finally part away from this stage. Our life is divided into seven different stages and in these stages, we keep on performing different roles seeking various things in our life as actors. Here in this worldly stage, we play the role of an infant, a boy, a lover, a soldier, a judge, an old man and an extremely old man.

He enters a nostalgic state, recalling his childhood when he used to sit and contemplate a sunset. He recalls how he used to enjoy such beauty when he was a young boy of about five or six years old. It's a wonder he still has a youthful aura about him. This presence is capable of appreciating the beauty of the evening. Perhaps he wants to come out of his shell, but his maturity and adulthood prevent him from doing so.

The poet has described a little boy, his surroundings, and his acts of peering (looking) and feeling about beautiful and wonderful nature in a beautiful and wonderful way. He has shared his childhood memories of being close to nature.

He seems longing for his childhood days much.

 Reference to the context 

a. Why do you think Cummings has placed a semicolon between the words window and at?

➜ I think Cummings has placed a semicolon between the words window and to break the two different locations. Here, he has used a semicolon to distinguish the locations inside and outside the window. Here, the little boy is sitting inside the window and peering at the beauty of November's sunset outside the window. The placement of semicolon has created the description of two different locations in relation to boy's acts.



b. If the speaker is the child grown up, why does he ask, “who are you”?

➜ He asks, "who are you" because he is feeling good in his memory to find his childhood days of a completely carefree life. He feels free from sufferings and burden of obligations. He asks so to express the pleasures of his carefree childhood days that are closely connected with nature.


c. In this poem, an adult reflects on the childhood experience. Based on that, what might be the theme of the lines: “(and feeling: that if day / has to become night / this is a beautiful way)”?

➜ Here, in these lines, we find the boy's feeling about the beautiful scene of November's golden sunset. The boy finds a quite beautiful way of transformation of golden colours of the sun of day time into black colours of the night. He feels about this wonderful transition of the beautiful nature. Thus, the theme of these lines might be the wonderful changes in this beautiful nature which are beyond humans' thoughts, feelings, emotions, ideas etc. These changes have deep effects on humans. Here, the theme in its deeper meaning also refers to the end of this life which is full of burdens of obligations and pains. The light of the day time refers the life whereas the darkness of night refers to death. The beautiful way of transformation of the day into the night also shows the concept of life and death. The speaker wants to be a child again leaving this life of sufferings.



d. What is the rhyme scheme used in the poem?

➜ A rhyme scheme is the pattern of sounds that repeats at the end of a line or stanza. The rhyme scheme used in the poem is ABAB and CDCD.



e. Explain the pun in “little i” that is related to what he is doing.

➜ A pun is a joke that reveals different possible meanings of a word. It also refers to the words that sound alike but have different meanings along with humour. Here, in the act of the 'little i', we find beautiful use of the pun. The 'little i' is peering golden sunset of November. The 'little i' or the boy has been presented here in some high window. Here, 'little i' and 'high' sound alike in rhyme scheme but create laughter for the readers to find out the meaning. The speaker has presented 'little i' in some high window's location. Here, the mismatched height of 'little i' and 'window' has been presented for the act of peering beautiful golden sunset of November which has created laughter. 


f. How does Cummings’s use of lowercase letters affect your understanding of the poem? Explain.

➜ Cummings's use of lowercase letters affect my understanding of the poem. The use of lowercase letters in his poem have different literal meanings beyond their forms. The style of using lowercase letters is considered to be incorrect in writing English grammatical form. His use of lowercase letters here in this poem has created a lot of difficulties for me to grasp the actual meaning of the poem.

The poem entitled "The Gift in Wartime" is written by Tran Mong Tu. The writer brought up in Vietnam. This poem is about the harsh effects of war on human lives. The speaker in the poem is the poet herself where she talks to her beloved and the war itself.

The poem begins with the speaker offering someone, an unnamed "you" (-referred to the beloved of the poet who is no more), roses and a wedding gown to cover the grassy grave. The poet says that the war replies by giving her medals, silver stars, and a badge. These things appear to be less significant than the items that the speaker offers to her beloved.

The speaker says that she offers her youth (beloved) to the war although they were in love with each other but in return, the war gives them the "smell of blood" i.e. death. The youth of the poet passed away with the bad news that is the death of her beloved.

The speaker offers cloud and cold winter to the unnamed "you". She means to say that she sacrificed the best thing of her life for the war but the war offered her a motionless body whose lips cannot make smiles and eye cannot make a sight.

At last, the speaker apologizes to her beloved for sending him to the war that took his life away from her. She promises his dead beloved that she would meet him in their next life. She wants to hold the shrapnel (a fragment of the exploding bomb) that will help them to recognize each other.

Analysis &Theme:

In the poem 'The Gift in Wartime', Tran addresses an absent person. For example, as she says, "l offer you roses," the person to whom she is speaking is not present and can neither hear nor understand what she is saying.
The speaker's attitude toward war is one of sadness and bitter irony.
Harsh effects of war in human life; death
Separation
Symbols used:
Visual imagery of roses, clouds, and the body of a corpse.
Figure of Speech:
Irony- gift: Death/shrapnel as tokens of remembrance
Apostrophe: The speaker uses an apostrophe to address a person who is not present or to an inanimate object; in this poem, the speaker addresses a corpse.
Anaphora: the repetition of the same words at the beginning of a line. Tu repeats the ironic "you give me" in stanzas three and five. This anaphora comes to a crescendo in stanza six, when the speaker repeats "you Give me" three times in a row, pounding us with the irony of the empty "gifts of death.
Metaphor: she compares her sadness to the "clouds" in her eyes on a summer day.""",

      Understanding the text 

Answer the following questions.
a. Who is the speaker addressing and why can that person not hear or understand what she is saying?

➜ The speaker is addressing an absent person (a lovable person). The person cannot hear or understand what she is saying because the person is no more.



b. What can you infer about the speaker’s feelings for the person addressed as “you”?

➜ I can infer that the speaker's feelings for the person addressed as 'you' are so deep. She thinks him as her life. She misses him a lot. She remembers him every moment in her life. She feels her life incomplete without him. Her deep feelings can easily be seen in the first stanza where she offers roses and her wedding gown for her lovable person's tomb.


c. What is the speaker’s attitude toward war?

➜ The speaker's attitude toward war is quite negative. She has experienced the terrible war between America and Vietnam. She has lost the most lovable person of her life due to war. Due to the lack of him, she has been experiencing pitiable lonely life. She has presented various negative aspects of the war in her poem.



d. In what ways do you think this person’s fate has affected the speaker?

➜ I think this person's fate has affected the speaker. The absent person who is mentioned here in this poem was a brave soldier who had got medals and a badge for his bravery in the war. In the war of America and Vietnam, he got killed in the bomb explosion. After his death, the speaker is experiencing his lack. She is quite sad in her lonely life. She keeps on remembering her lovable person all the time. The ill-fate of the person has made her helpless, loveless and miserable.



e. What does the speaker promise at the end of the poem? Why do you think the speaker does this?

➜ At the end of the poem, the speaker promises to meet her lovable person in their next life. She wants to hold shrapnel as proof to show him the reason behind his death and their separation. According to her, it will help them to recognize each other. I think the speaker does this because her love for the absent person is so deep. She wants to love with him again and again.


 Reference to the context 

a. What is the theme of the poem?

➜ The theme of the poem is the inhumanity and cruelty of the war and its negative impacts over humans. War never brings happiness for others but only snatches the happiness of others. It only invites disparity and dark future for others. Humans get extremely affected by war. War only provides gifts as death, blood, pains, loss, sorrows, destruction, downfall etc.



b. What imagery from the poem made the greatest impression on you? Why?

➜ The imagery is a literary device to represent things through the use of images. The speaker has used various images here in this poem to put forward her feelings against war. Here, we find images as roses on grave, wedding gown as a cover, a tomb with green grass, medals, badge, youth days, wardress with blood, clouds, winters, lips without a smile, arms without tenderness, eye without sight, the body without motion, shrapnel as a token etc. Here, the imagery from the sixth stanza made a great impression on me because here in the sixth stanza, the speaker relates to all those things which she has got from her missing lovable person. Due to the bad impacts of war, her lovable person has left her providing lips without a smile, arms without tenderness, eyes without sight and the body without motion. This stanza has shown the pitiable condition of the speaker's lonely life without her lovable person.


c. Which figurative language is used in the poem? Explain with examples.

➜ Figurative language is phrasing that the goes beyond the literal meaning of words to get a message. We find the use of irony, apostrophe, anaphora, and metaphor as the figurative language here in this poem. The post has used imageries and metaphors much.

The title of this poem itself is ironic which refers to the gifts of war as pains, sorrows, losses, blood etc. to humans.

Next, the poet has also used the literary device of the apostrophe, which refers to a sudden exclamatory piece of dialogue addressed to someone or something, especially absent. Here in this poem, the speaker addresses an absent person and says him about the inhuman picture of war. Anaphora refers to the repetition of the same words at the beginning of a line. Here, the poet has used the same words at the beginning of the line as "You give me" in the second, fourth and sixth stanza. These words have been repeated thrice in the sixth stanza. Here, the poet has presented an irony relating with the gifts which the war, as well as her lovable person (a soldier), has provided her.



d. What does the speaker “offer” in this poem? What does the person addressed as “you” give in return?

➜ The speaker offers various things in this poem to her lovable person. She offers roses, her wedding gown, her youth, clouds, cold winters etc. The person addressed as "you" gives her the medals with shining stars, badge with yellow pips, the smell of blood from wardress, lips without a smile, arms without tenderness, eyes without sight, body without motion etc.


e. An apostrophe is a literary device in which a writer or speaker addresses an absent person or an abstract idea in such a way as if it were present and can understand. Discuss the poem in relation to apostrophe.

➜ This poem "The Gifts in Wartime" is about the inhuman picture of war and its effects on humans. Here, the speaker has perfectly made use of apostrophe where she is seen addressing an absent person. Here, she is using her convincing lines for the person who is no more. She tries her best to make him realise about her deep lovable feelings for him. From the first stanza to the last, she keeps on making the absent person realise about her presents, sacrifices, Ionely feelings, helplessness, the gifts of war as medals, badge, army dress with painful feelings, death, etc. She relates to him about her lonely life where she has experienced a lot of pains without him. She has even made him realise the main reason behind his death and their separation. This poem has presented the speaker and her dialogues for the absent person in such a way if the person is listening and understanding all her words. This poem has shown the bitter reality of war on humans through the speaker's dialogues for her absent lovable person using the apostrophe.



 Reference beyond the text 

a. One way to get relief from grief is to write or talk about it. In your opinion, how might the speaker in this poem have benefitted from saying what she did? Explain.

➜ The speaker here in this poem has become successful to convey a serious message about the inhumanity of war to all her readers. War always invites a dark future for all. The victim in the battlefield isnt only the sufferer but also all those people who are closely connected with him/her. The speaker of this poem has also become the victim of the war along with her lovable person's death. Here, the saying of the speaker related with her acts and her sacrifices in her lonely life might have benefited her to forward her experience of war as a sufferer to all her readers. The readers have got ideas about the bad impacts of war and its long term effects on humans through her painful feelings.


b. Write an essay on the effects of war.

➜ War is a situation or a period of fighting between countries or groups of people. War generally involves the use of weapons, a military organization and soldiers. War is a situation in which a nation enforces its rights by using force. War is the bitter reality through which the downfall of humans is created. It is good for nothing. War and its effects on humans are seen in both aspects: physical and psychological. War creates long term effects on humans. War invites a dark future for all. War never provides happiness to others but snatches the happiness of others. The victims of war always remain in fear. It snatches thousands of lives. Death, injury, sexual violence, malnutrition, illness, and disability etc are some of the most threatening physical consequences of war, while post-traumatic stress disorder (PSTD), depression, and anxiety are some of the psychological effects.

Here, LaPena has emphasized on our traditional and cultural values which are very much important for our bright future. According to him, we must listen to our elders to maintain our cultural and traditional norms and values. 



In this essay, LaPena has put forward his opinions in favour of oral its preservation. He has even talked about different factors which have affected oral tradition and created problems to maintain our culture and values. 


MAIN SUMMARY 

Frank LePena talks about the instance of oral tradition. In this essay, he keeps on telling all his readers about his experiences and thoughts related to oral tradition. According to him, the oral tradition refers to a form of art of human communication where knowledge, art, ideas and cultural material is received, preserved and transmitted orally from generation to generation. In other words, oral tradition is about passing on information related to cultures and values from generation to generation through oral means. This transmission is made through speech or song, folktales, ballads, chants, prose or verses etc. Oral tradition helps to maintain the values of the culture. The task of sharing tradition isn't minor. The task of sharing tradition through oral means seems easy to talk and write but quite hard to practice. Here, both the elders and young people play a very vital role to maintain and preserve the values of the culture. The role of speakers (elders) and listeners (young people or followers) is very important. The knowledge of elders related to cultures, traditions, religions, and values must be listened and followed properly by young people. The elders share the traditions and various concepts related to culture and value to the young people. After the death of elderly people, young people have to fill up their places being responsible. They have to take responsibility for sharing tradition after elders through oral tradition to maintain cultures and values in their community. In this way, the oral tradition keeps on moving generation to generation preserving cultures and values.

        """JBS Haldane, a British-Indian Scientist, wrote this personal essay titled "What I Require From Life." This essay was first published in 1940 in the newspaper "The Daily Worker." This essay has included a variety of political and philosophical viewpoints on the necessities of people's lives. 

It has primarily focused on socialistic convictions demanding democratic workplace activities. This essay has discussed the various needs of working-class people who are living their lives in various circumstances while trying to make ends meet. In this essay, the writer has used very simple and clear language in his writing style to discuss his needs and life experiences. His needs in life are similar to those of the majority of the world's working-class people.

The author begins with his thoughts on his acceptance of the concept of the world as it is. He believes that he should not require the impossible in his life. He claims that imagining perfect beings in a perfect world will cause him to do more harm than good to others. 


He was born in a peaceful era, according to the author. During his youth, he desired to live a peaceful life, but due to the outbreak of devastating World War I in 1914, he became involved in his heroic age. The devastation of World War I altered his outlook on peaceful living. In that critical situation in which he found himself, he desired to make the most of his time by attending to his basic needs such as food, water, clothing, and shelter.

The writer has discussed four general human needs that are quite important in this essay. These four general needs, which the writer and others require, are freedom, health, work, and friendship.

Freedom: The writer needs to be able to work freely. Everyone requires freedom. The writer values freedom of expression the most. He wishes to say and write about various poisonous aspects, but the law of libel forbids him.


Health: In order to work in his life, the writer must be in good health. People who are in good health are able to obtain all of the necessities in life. Good health brings happiness and success in life.

Work: The writer needs work with a decent salary, which is essential for everyone. He considers himself fortunate to have been able to choose his desired work to a large extent. He claims that, aside from his scientific work, he could easily be a war correspondent, write children's stories, or deliver political speeches.

Friendship: The writer then requires the friendship of his coworkers and comrades. He prefers equality in society, where criticism can be freely expressed. His friendship must be free of the concept of obeying and ordering without question. Friendship should be formed with people of equal standing.

Aside from these basic needs, the writer has a number of desires in his life. He craves adventure in his life, even if it comes with risk. 


According to him, the satisfaction of adventure is far more substantial than a thrill. He wishes to have his own room with books, a car, a daily bath, and easy access to a beach or a river. He wishes for all of these things but does not make demands for them. The writer considers himself fortunate to be able to enjoy his basic needs, but his pleasures are rendered ineffective if his friends do not find happiness in these necessities. 

He wants to see healthy people working on the planet. All workers at work must find fruits that are appropriate for their abilities. They should work hard for their own profits as well as the well-being of their friends, but not for the profits of others.

The author wishes to see workers in control of their working conditions. As a socialist, he wishes to see a situation in which workers play critical roles and control the industry. He wishes to see the end of class and sex subjection. In order to achieve fraternity, people must be treated equally. There should be an economic revolution to end class and sexual oppression.


The writer would rather die happy than see capitalism is overthrown and workers take control of most of Europe. He wishes to see the end of fascism, which caused the First World War and the breakdown of the peace.

The author wishes to see education and scientific methods used in all aspects of life spread. Finally, he wishes to die if he can fulfil only two of Aristotle's death conditions.""",

Answer the following questions.

a. How does the writer distinguish between a peaceful age and a heroic age?

➜ The writer distinguishes between a period of peace and a period of heroism, and compares two different periods: he calls the moment of birth a period of peace and his youth as a period of heroism. When the First World War broke out (22 years old), he wanted to live in peace but devoted himself to the heroic war.



b. Why does the writer want more freedom of speech than most people?

➜ The writer wants more freedom of speech than most people because he wants to freely talk and write about very dangerous people and institutions. He wants to write against the capitalists who have rioted all the industries. He wants to write what he thinks about.


c. According to the writer, what are the four general human needs?

➜ According to the writer, work, freedom of speech, health and friend are the four general human needs.



d. What is the difference between desire and demand according to the writer?

➜ According to the author, the difference between desire and demand is that desire is a simple wish for a person to have a specific benefit in life, and demand is a desire that is specifically supported by the ability and willingness to pay for a particular good. The writer wants different things but does not ask for them, but he can happily fulfil all his wishes.



e. Why does the writer demand security?

➜ The author calls for security because the safety of life is more important than any other aspect. Life safety is the primary aspect while other requirements are secondary. During critical times of war, the writer first claims the security of life. If the security of life is insured, anything can be possible.


 Reference to the context 

Explain the following lines with reference to the context:

a. “The satisfaction of adventure is something much more solid than a thrill.”

➜ The author believes that adventure is not only about emotions, but also about satisfaction in performing a creative activity. He served on the war front in Madrid for six months and looked forward to reading a book of Rimbaud's poetry for a thrill.



b. “I want the workers to see the fruit of their own work not in profits for others, but in their own and their friends’ well-being.”

➜ Here in this line, the author, as a socialist, wants the workers to exercise the fruits of their labour so as not to enrich the bourgeois capitalists but to benefit from the wages of the workers themselves for their own economic prosperity.



c. Why do you think the essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosophers?

➜  I think the essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosophers because he wants to strengthen his arguments and provide us with specific details about the paragraphs he has provided.


d. Discuss the essay in terms of its language, purpose, subject, point of view and mode of writing.

➜ The writer has used simple and clear language to express his ideas about socialism in this essay. He has done his best to present various needs of people from their daily lives.

He has discussed various issues concerning the needs, rights, and classes of people in his presentation of the major subject of life-related requirements. He has voiced his opposition to capitalism, which has resulted in widespread unemployment. As a social critic, his point of view can be seen in the essay. He began his essay in a descriptive mode, but later on, he presented his political arguments in order to persuade his readers.



 Reference beyond the text 

a. What do you require from your life to be happy and satisfied?

➜ To be happy and satisfied, I require good health, a job, friendship, freedom & security from my life.



b. What is socialism? How is it different from capitalism?

➜ Socialism is a system of social and economic equality in which private property and ownership are not prioritized. It differs from capitalism because capitalism does not provide economic equality. Capitalism, unlike socialism, ignores people's needs and does not promote equal opportunity.


c. Write an essay about your dream house.

➜ My Dream House

My dream home is a place of beauty, serenity and inspiration. It is a bungalow with a huge lawn, planted with fruit trees and flowering plants. There is plenty of space for a table and chairs so that when the weather is fine, my family can sit outside to have a meal or read the newspapers. There is also a lovely waterfall in the garden to soothe our minds with the sound of water falling. Birds perch on the trees to sing or nest and give us free concerts. 

My dream home is large and spacious. There are plenty of windows to make the place bright and airy. I do hate houses that are small, cramped and all shut up. It is for this reason that I dislike living in flats or condominiums. Every room in my dream house and every piece of furniture in it is designed to create beauty, warmth and peace. 

My kitchen is small and neat. I am not a fussy cook so I do not need a large kitchen. In Malaysia, one does not really need to cook all the time since there are plenty of restaurants. However, if I ever cook or bake, I would like to do it on the latest Italian hob and oven. My dream kitchen has a huge refrigerator and is fitted with cabinets made of oak. It also has a radio-CD player so that I can listen to music as I do my cooking.

All the bedrooms in my dream house are spacious. They have attached bathrooms and are fully air-conditioned. Each has a mini-refrigerator stocked with drinks and tidbits so that there is always something to munch on even in the bedroom. One of the most important rooms in my dream house is the library. Wonderful books on every subject in the world fill up the shelves that line the walls. I also have the latest table-top computer here on which I work or surf the internet. 

Another important room is the music room where I have the latest hi-fi system to play songs and music from all over the world. I love music. My grand piano is also placed there where I often play pieces that I have composed myself. 

My dream home is a place of joy, peace and beauty. Right now it exists only in my dreams. Someday, I hope it will become reality."""

With the signature of Jo Goodwin Parker, this essay was mailed to George Henderson, a professor at the University of Oklahoma. This essay was later published with no further information about its author or source. The essay was published with the facts of a woman's hardships as a result of poverty.
In this essay, we learn about the writer's painful experiences in her life as a result of her poverty. She has described her miserable experiences ranging from childhood to adulthood, during which she has faced a variety of adversities.

She has discussed various aspects of poverty in this essay. She has provided a realistic and graphic account of what it is like to be poor on a daily basis. Poverty, she claims, is more heinous and cruel than depicted in the media.



Poverty, according to her, is a state of living without hope, better food, medical care, proper sanitation, and proper education. It's like an acid that eats away at one's pride, honour, health, and future. Parker's main goal is to demonstrate how humiliating, and disgusting it is to be poor. She wishes to draw the attention of the readers to the plight of the poor. She wants her readers to understand poverty without feeling sorry for her.

Poor people live restless life, fearing for their children's future. Poverty shatters relationships. Parker was the mother of three children. Because of their financial situation, her husband abandoned her. 

He didn't have a steady job. Due to the burden of his family, he abandoned all of them without even saying goodbye. During that time, their condition deteriorated. They didn't even have enough money to buy contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancies. She was employed. She was only making 22 dollar per week at the time. 


She had anaemia as a result of her poor diet. The doctor advised her to have surgery, but she did not have the funds. She struggled alone to care for her children and faced a variety of difficulties during the cold and summer seasons' days and nights.

She once left her children in the care of her mother. When she returned home, however, she discovered her children in a pitiful state. 

Her youngest son was covered in fly specks, and he hadn't had his diaper changed since the morning. Her next child was playing with broken glasses, and her oldest son was alone at the lake's edge. She didn't have enough money to enrol them in a nursery school. 

She had to pay 20 dollar per week for three children to be admitted. Her income, however, was only 22 dollar. She decided to leave her job in order to care for the children.""",

Answer the following questions.

a. What is poverty according to Parker?

➜ Poverty, according to Parker, is a lack of hope, better foods, medical care, proper sanitation, and proper education. It's like an acid that eats away at one's pride, honour, health, and future.



b. How is poverty difficult for Parker’s children? List some specific examples.

➜ Parker's three children are severely disadvantaged as a result of their family's financial situation. They live in misery as a result of a lack of adequate food, education, clothing, and medical care. Parker has brought her children's deteriorating health into the discussion. She has given us information about the poor condition of her children. They used to have oilless corn cornbread for breakfast, according to her. They used to dress in filthy clothes. They were not enrolled in a formal school. Parker has told us about an incident that occurred one day when she left her children in the care of her mother while she went to work. That day, after work, she discovered her youngest covered in flyspecks, whose diaper hadn't been changed since the morning. Her next son was tinkering with the shattered glasses. Her eldest son was playing on the edge of the lake.


c. How does Parker try to obtain help, and what problems does she encounter?

➜ Parker tries to get help for her children by spreading her hands in front of various people and institutions. Due to a lack of funds, she makes every effort to find supportive hands most of the time. Most of the time, she has difficulty locating the appropriate organization and person to assist her. She must transfer to new organizations. She has to wait and tell her dreadful story over and over.



d. Why are people’s opinions and prejudices her greatest obstacles?

➜ People's opinions and prejudices are her greatest obstacles because they prevent her from receiving supportive hands for her family's sake. The majority of people are unaware of the agony of poverty. Poor people's suffering is insignificant to them. They continue to express their prejudices and opinions about poor people. In Parker's case, people's opinions and prejudices prevent her from obtaining assistance to run her family.



e. How does Parker defend her inability to get help? How does she discount the usual solutions society has for poverty (e.g., welfare, education, and health clinics)?

➜ Parker defends her inability to get help and support by expressing her feelings about her poverty experiences. She dismisses society's usual solutions to poverty by recounting her own experiences with welfare, education, and health clinics. According to her, in the name of welfare, she must move and spread her hands in a variety of agencies across the country. She has to deal with shame all the time in these organizations. She must repeatedly demonstrate her poverty. She has to retell her story several times. Sometimes welfare programs promise to assist, but getting to them takes a long time. School launch programs exist in the name of education, but they serve no purpose. She has witnessed the condition of her two children after sending them to school. When it comes to the most important aspects of health clinics, Parker's life is far from the facilities of health clinics. She has to walk for miles to get medical help. If she asks for help, the helper anticipates negative outcomes from her. As a result, Parker is completely disconnected from all three critical aspects.


 Reference to the context 

a. Explain the following:

 Poverty is looking into a black future.

➜ The writer Jo Goodwin Parker stated in her essay, "Poverty is looking into a black future." She has presented this line to her readers in order to present her experience with poverty. The writer is advising all of the readers in this line about an ugly and cruel aspect of poverty. Poverty, according to her, leads people to a dark future. On a daily basis, poor people must endure a miserable existence. It is extremely difficult to provide them with adequate daily foods. There is no future hope for them. They continue to live in disparity, looking forward to a black future. Poverty shatters future hopes and dreams.



b. What does Parker mean by “The poor are always silent”?

➜ Parker is referring to poor people's helplessness when she says "the poor are always silent." Money is extremely important in poverty. Money is the perfect solution to all problems. Poor people, on the other hand, feel weaker as a result of a lack of resources. They always keep their mouths shut in front of others. Because of their pitiful state, they must listen to others' words while remaining silent.


c. What writing strategy does the author use at the beginning of most of the paragraphs? Do you notice a recurring pattern? What is it?

➜ The author employs her repetition strategy at the beginning of the majority of the paragraphs in this essay. Yes, I've noticed a recurring pattern, and it's the structure "Poverty is." The essay is well-organized, with the phrase "Poverty is" repeated at the beginning of each paragraph. She attempts to establish a relationship between the woman and the readers here by using her repetition strategy. Because of the author's casual style, the writing appears to be part of a casual conversation between the narrator and the readers. Goodwin Parker's writing is extremely effective and accomplishes its goal.



d. How does Parker develop each paragraph? What details make each paragraph memorable?

➜ Parker begins each paragraph with her repetition strategy. She begins the majority of her paragraphs with a repetition statement such as "Poverty is." She then shares her personal experiences with her topic sentences. The author first makes it clear to her readers that her goal is to help them understand what poverty is. Her second goal is to persuade all of her readers to help those in need. Each paragraph is memorable because of the details related to her personal painful experiences and the harsh reality of poverty.


e. In the final paragraph, how does the author use questions to involve the reader in the issue of poverty?

➜ The author uses questions in her informal style of direct conversation in the final paragraph to engage the readers in the issue of poverty. Parker has done an excellent job of engrossing her readers with her persuasive style. She instructs them to look at the poor with an angry heart rather than a pitiful heart. This style of question has piqued the readers' emotions as well as their attention. In the final paragraph, she has succeeded in drawing her readers' attention to her plight and the struggles of others in her situation.



 Reference beyond the text 

a. Define a social problem (homelessness, unemployment, racism) imitating Parker’s style.

➜ Sleeping on the streets is a form of homelessness. Homelessness forces you to sleep on the sidewalks. Living life on footpaths weakens you in a variety of ways. It is the end of your pride and prestige.

Unemployment is a life of embarrassment. Unemployment reduces your social value. You are constantly ashamed and humiliated because you do not have a job. People make fun of you because you are unemployed.

Racism is a humiliating way of life. Racists make you feel socially inferior. They continue to degrade you because of your skin colour. You will be humiliated in your society because of your skin colour. It is a curse to live your life under the guise of racism.


b. Using adjectives to highlight the futility of the situation, write a short definition essay on Growing up in Poverty.

➜ Poverty is defined as a pitiful situation in which people lack a variety of essentials in their lives. Aside from other people's perspectives, I believe that growing up in poverty is vexing. You can never be happy if you are poor. The majority of the time, poverty irritates you. Growing up in poverty is a tedious experience. You never try to do anything interesting because you are poor. Growing up in poverty is both perplexing and discouraging. You are constantly perplexed by your life. Disparity and inequality never allow you to be free and do good in your life. Growing up in poverty is a terrifying experience that exposes you to a variety of hardships and struggles. It gives you a tiring and worrying experience where pains are always waiting to greet you."""

Main Summary:
Vladimir Koillis-Borok, a Russian mathematical geophysicist and seismologist, wrote the essay "Scientific Research is a Token of Humankind Survival." This essay has presented facts about science and its significant contribution to the lives of people all over the world. This essay demonstrated how scientists from all over the world rise above their national identities to solve common problems that affect all nations. This essay's speaker is the author himself. Here, he defends science, claiming that science is the indispensable guardian and caretaker of humanity.

The author begins with the profession of a scientist, stating that scientists earn less than businessmen, lawyers, and doctors. Despite this, some people choose to be scientists because they cannot live without science. According to the author, science is an exciting adventure in which the main reward is the discovery itself. Instead of large sums of money, the scientist receives honours and promotions as a result of his or her discoveries. A scientist earns less money than lawyers, doctors, and businessmen, but he or she enjoys more freedom, camaraderie, and independence.

The author then tells his readers about his experiences during the Cold War. The author claims that in 1960 while conducting research on seismic waves (Earth tremors) in Moscow, he was summoned by the President of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The President showed him a letter from Geneva pertaining to a Geneva meeting on nuclear weapons. Fran Press, an American scientist, summoned him to Geneva for the discussion. As a result, the author ended up in Geneva.

The fear of nuclear annihilation was extremely high at the time. People were under threat. The cold war was at its peak in 1960. Russia (Soviet Union), America, and the United Kingdom all possessed a large number of nuclear weapons. They could easily destroy other countries with nuclear weapons in their first strike. 

Prior to the Geneva Summit, three powerful nations made an important decision for the sake of humanity's survival. The three nuclear powers were willing to reach an agreement prohibiting new nuclear weapons tests. That was the atmosphere of the cold war when scientists from opposing sides had to reach an agreement to promote world peace and prevent the use of nuclear weapons. That episode taught the writer that science is the only hope for everyone's survival and well-being.

The writer was a seismologist with theoretical knowledge of seismic waves. His theoretical knowledge had a direct application in the field of human survival. He was well-versed in tremors caused by underground nuclear explosions as well as tremors caused by earthquakes. The writer would be able to tell the difference between the two tremors based on his knowledge.

Scientists, according to the author, are the most practical people on the planet. This could be seen in new technologies and industry brands ranging from defence to entertainment. Antibiotics, electronics, biotechnology, synthetic fibres, the green revolution, and genetic forensic diagnosis are all inventions of scientists. People's lives are always aided by a basic understanding of science.

Natural and man-made disasters, according to the author, are threatening the survival of our civilization. Natural disasters include earthquakes, self-inflicted destruction of megacities, environmental disasters, and economic and social crises. Man-made disasters cited by the author include a massive release of radioactivity from nuclear waste disposal and an outbreak of mass violence.

Science is our unavoidable protector and caretaker because it is the only science capable of ensuring that we move with time safely.

Countries signed a treaty not to test nuclear weapons in secret for the sake of humanity's survival. However, science and its scientists ensured humanity's survival. It is the only science capable of distinguishing between tremors caused by nuclear explosions and natural earthquakes. Science can provide us with new energy sources, mineral deposits, and effective anti-terrorism defences.

Science's hope for humanity's survival has a broader significance as well. In the current scenario, both natural and man-made disasters endanger humanity's safety. Whether it is a tsunami or terrorism, money alone will not solve the problem. The only hope is for scientific solutions. Thus, the author has a plethora of reasons to conclude that science is the only hope for survival.

MAIN SUMMARY OF 👇

Trifles by Susan Glaspell

The play begins in the farmhouse of Mr. John Wright. In the beginning, we find all the characters entering into Mr. Wright's kitchen. Firstly, County Attorney Mr. George Henderson, Mr. Henry Peters and Mr. Lewis Hale enter the kitchen. All these men are followed by Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale. The condition of the kitchen is completely messy. When they reach there, they find everything shabby and abandoned. The dishes in the kitchen lay scattered, a loaf of bread is out of the bread box, a dishtowel on the table, unwashed pans under the sink etc. It seems as if it is a sign of incomplete work. 



All the male characters move near the fireplace whereas the women stand at the door. The County Attorney Mr. Henderson inspects the things in the kitchen confirming whether the things are touched or not.



He starts his investigation with a question to Mr. Hale about the previous day's events. [ Mr. Hale is a person who witnessed the dead body of Mr. Wright at first. Mr. Hale relates that he visited Mr. Wright's house to ask about getting a telephone line. He met Mrs. Wright sitting on a rocker (a chair) moving back and forth. She seemed quite strange and nervous while pleating her apron. She strangely behaved with Mr. Hale. She informed Mr. Hale about her husband's death upstairs with a rope around his neck. She said that someone strangled her husband when she was in her sound sleep. She added that she didn't hear anything from her husband during nighttime. After that, Mr. Hale informed about the death of Mr. John Wright to Mr. Henry Peters and brought him to the spot to see the dead body. He even went to bring the coroner, an official related to the investigation of suspicious deaths. When Mr. Hale talked about the telephone to Mrs. Wright, she laughed and even scared. 



The County Attorney Mr. George Henderson begins his investigation from the kitchen. He inspects some fruits preservatives broken glass jars in the cupboard's closets. The broken jars' glasses have made the cupboard so messy.



Both, Mr. Henderson and Mr. Peters criticize the trifles worries related to preservatives jars of Mrs. Wright who has been accused and arrested for her husband's murder. 



Mr. Henderson keeps on criticising Mrs. Wright's housekeeping skills and a dirty towel. But, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters support Mrs. Wright being women. Both women don't like Mr. Hale's dialogue. Mr. Hale says that women worry over the trifles. Both women come closer to each other after hearing his dialogue. The men move upstairs to search for evidence. Mr. Henderson allows both women to gather the belongings for Mrs. Wright. When Mrs. Hale arranges a pan in the kitchen, Mr. Henderson disturbs her. Mrs. Hale doesn't like Mr. Henderson's task of criticising women. Both women take clothes for Mrs. Wright from her closet. Later on, both women start talking about Mrs. Wright. Mrs. Hale relates about Mrs. Wright to Mrs. Peters. According to her, Mrs. Wright was a quite famous singer thirty years ago and known as Minnie Foster. She was so beautiful and cheerful then. She used to wear a pretty dress and sing quite beautifully. But, after her marriage, her happiness ended. Her husband was a quite strict person. He didn't allow her to join women's aid. After marriage, she mostly wore an apron with a shawl which was hung behind the door. Mrs. Hale considers Mrs. Wright as an innocent woman who worries about fruits preservatives jars. Both women don't think that Mrs. Wright murdered her husband.



According to Mrs. Peters, her husband doubts Mrs. Wright. He didn't believe Mrs. Wright's act of not waking up at night time during the murder. Mrs. Hale even mentions that her husband found a gun in the house. It is very suspicious to use a rope for murder instead of a gun. Mrs. Hale is worried about Mrs. Wright who is locked in the town's prison. 



A bit later, Mrs. Hale finds a large sewing basket with a quilt. When they examine the quilt, they find the stitches in the quilt aren't well-stitched. They infer about Mrs.Wright's nervousness while stitching the quilt.  When the men hear women's discussion related to quilt and knots, they laugh and ridicule the trifle tasks of women. The men go to the barn to search for the evidence.



Both women want to complete the unfinished quilt. While searching for paper and string, Mrs.Peters finds a birdcage in a cupboard. There isn't a bird and the door of the cage is broken. Mrs. Hale remembers a man who was selling singing birds canaries around the previous year. They infer Mr. Wright must have bought a canary from him. Mrs. Hale guesses that the cat might have caught the bird of the cage. But, Mrs. Peters informs Mrs. Hale that Mrs. Wright didn't have a cat. She says that her cat once went into Mrs. Wright's room and made her upset. Mrs. Hale worries about not visiting Mrs. Wright house these days. According to her, she never liked this lonesome and gloomy place which is quite hollow and too far from the road. Mrs. Hale adds that Mr.Wright was quite a hard man to live with. There were no children in the house. Mrs. Wright had to spend her time in loneliness while Mr. Wright was at his work. Mrs. Hale guesses that Mrs. Wright must have bought a canary for her company. Mrs. Hale says that she was like a bird, real sweet and pretty, singing beautifully in a choir before marriage. She wonders how did she change.



Later on, Mrs. Hale finds a pretty red box in the sewing basket while searching for scissors to fix the stitches made by Mrs. Wright. Both of them are quite surprised to find a dead canary wrapped in a silk cloth. They feel terrified to see the wrung neck of the bird. When they hear the sound of men coming back from the barn, they hide the red box among the quilt pieces. Mr. Henderson again ridicules the women asking about the blanket whether it was knotted or quilted. Mrs. Peters answered decisively saying that Mrs. Wright wanted to knot it. The men discuss finding no evidence in the barn.



Next, the men discuss about rope which was the house's rope and used for murdering Mr. Wright. They move upstairs again to make an analysis of the rope inch by inch.



Now, both women get a new insight into Mrs. Wright's situation. Mrs. Hale says that Mrs. Wright was trying to bury her lovely bird in a pretty red box. Mrs. Peters recalls an incident of her past days and becomes sad. According to her, she had a beautiful kitten when she was a girl. But, a boy killed her kitten brutally with a hatchet before her eyes. Quite interestingly, she says that if she had been bold enough, she would have hurt the boy. Here, Mrs. Peters opinions reveal the concept of revenge. Both women try to connect the case of killing a bird to the murder of Mr. Wright. Mrs. Hale concludes that Mr. Wright was a strict man who didn't like his wife singing and even a singing bird-like canary. After many years of emptiness in the house, a bird started singing. She is sure that Mr. Wright must have killed the bird being furious.



Mrs. Peters relates her own experience of stillness (emptiness). She lost her first two years old baby in the past. After the death of the baby, she passed her tough time without her baby. But, she adds that the law has to punish the crime. Mrs. Hale also recalls Mrs. Wright while she was a signer. She feels guilty for not visiting and supporting Mrs. Wright in her needs during these days. 



Mrs. Hale becomes sympathetic towards Mrs. Wright and decides not to tell about broken jars of preservatives. Mrs. Peters wraps a fine jar of preservatives in a petticoat for Mrs. Wright. They don't want to make her sad. Mrs. Peters knows that the men would laugh at them being upset over the dead canary. 



The men come downstairs saying they need definite evidence for the culprit. Mr. Henderson doesn't seem satisfied. To proceed with the case further, he wishes to stay there for any other clue. Mrs. Peters asks Mr. Henderson to verify the belongings of Mrs. Wright which she has taken. Mr. Henderson verifies them randomly saying that she is also tied with the law being a sheriff's wife. The sheriff and coroner move to the other room's window to look for evidence. Mr. Hale also goes out.



Both women conceal the evidence related to Mrs. Wright. Mrs. Peters try to hide the box in her bag but the box is too big. She tries to catch the canary but cannot touch it. Mrs. Hale snatches the box from Mrs. Peters and puts it into her big coat's pocket as she hears the door's sound in the other room.



This play ends up with the conversation between Mr. Henderson and Mrs. Hale. Mr. Henderson asks the ladies sarcastically about Mrs. Wright saying that she was not going to quilt it. But, Mrs. Hale defends Mrs. Wright saying that she was going to knot.

    'exercise': """  Understanding the text 

Answer the following questions.

a. Do you believe that Mrs. Wright killed her husband? Explain.

➜ Yes, I believe Mrs. Wright murdered her husband. After reading the entire play, I believe she is a murderer. Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters' thorough investigation into Mrs. Wright's minor transgressions revealed all of the evidence against her and proved her to be a murderer.



b. Do you think Mr. Wright’s death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn’t stopped by the Wrights’ home?

➜ No, I don't think Mr. Wright's death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn't stopped by the Wright's home. Nobody would have known about Mr. Wright's death if Mr. Hale hadn't stopped by the Wrights' house. The house was located quite far from the road. Nobody had been to this lonely house in a long time. Mr. Wright's body would have decayed in that gloomy house if Mr. Hale hadn't stopped there to ask for a phone line.



c. Why does Mrs. Hale think that Mrs. Wright’s worries about her preserves indicate her innocence?

➜ Mrs. Hale thinks that Mrs. Wright's worries about her preserves indicate her innocence because Mrs. Wright does not strike her as a murderer who is obsessed with her housekeeping abilities. According to her, a person who is overly concerned with her preserves cannot possibly commit murder. Her attention to detail in her housekeeping skills demonstrates her innocence.


d. How does Mrs. Peters’ homesteading experience connect her to Mrs. Wright?

➜ Mrs. Peters' homesteading experience connects her to Mrs. Wright in the following ways:

She had a kitten when she was a girl. In front of her eyes, a boy killed it with a hatchet. She became enraged at the boy. She felt a sense of vengeance toward the boy. This encounter connects her to Mrs. Wright's vengeance against the assassin of her canary.
She lost her first child when she was two years old. She had gone through a difficult period without her adorable child. This experience connects her to Mrs. Wright's difficult time without her beloved canary.


e. How do the women’s perspectives on men differ?

➜ Men's arrogance and dominance are on display in this play. They have demonstrated their superiority over women. We think they're showy and pointless. Most of the time, they make fun of women. Throughout the investigation, men constantly mock women's perspectives. All men do not take women's acts and discussions seriously. Women's perspectives are taken as trifles by men.

Main Summary:
"A Sunny Morning" is a one-act love comedy written by two prominent Spanish writers, Serafin and Joaquin Alvarez Quintero. This romantic comedy has been provided with the intention of entertaining the audience. This play is built on the central theme of a love affair, with two ex-lovers in their 70s reuniting in a park and reminiscing about their romantic past. This one-act play is about two former lovers, Don Gonzalo and Dona Llorente, who adored each other when they were younger. During their youth, they were estranged from each other due to ill luck and Dona Llorente's parents' unfavourable roles.

Gonzalo and Dona are both pretty old now, having outlived their youthful exuberance and allure. When they first meet at the park, they are unable to recognize each other. However, they subsequently learn that they know each other but do not divulge their true identities to each other.

This play begins on one of autumn's peaceful sunny mornings in a peaceful corner of a park in Madrid, Spain. At the start, we see a handsome, white-haired lady in her seventies sitting on a park bench and feeding bread crumbs to pigeons. Her appearance is quite refined. She's there, along with her maid Petra. Petra later leaves the area to meet with the park guard. The arrival of another main character, Don Gonzalo, an elderly man, and his servant Juanito follows. Don Gonzalo appears to be irritated at first because he cannot find a vacant bench in the park to sit on.


Three priests have taken over the bench he usually sits on in the park. He approaches Laura's bench and shares it, despite his reluctance. Laura is enraged by Don Gonzalo. She accuses Don Gonzalo of frightening pigeons who were feeding her breadcrumbs. She refers to him as "an ill-natured man." Don Gonzalo dislikes sitting on the bench with the old lady. Laura continues to use harsh language against Don Gonzalo. Don Gonzalo, on the other hand, gives up after using their pinching and rude words of disagreement. He pulls out his snuffbox and hands it to her. They both sneeze at the same time. Finally, they reestablish a friendly relationship with one another.

They begin their conversations in a very friendly manner. Don Gonzalo reads aloud from a collection of poems. During their conversation, Gonzalo mentions that he is from Valencia. When he learns about Laura's home country, he is taken aback. Laura tells him she is from Maricela, where she grew up in a villa. Gonzalo is taken aback by Laura's revelation and says he knows a woman named Laura Llorente who lived in a villa there and was possibly the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. After hearing each other, they realize they were once lovers. However, they pretend to be anonymous.

They both begin talking about Laura Llorente and Gonzalo. Gonzalo and Laura Llorente are referred to as cousins and friends by old Don Gonzalo and Dona Laura. In their conversation, they express their feelings about Gonzalo and Laura Llorente's tragic love affair. Laura Llorente lived at Maricela in Valencia, according to their conversation. In her youth, she was known as 'The Silver Maiden' in her community. She was as lovely as a lily, with jet black hair and black eyes. She was a beautiful lady with a dreamy figure.


Gonzalo, the gallant lover, had captured her heart. Every morning, he would ride through the rose garden on horseback and toss a bouquet to her balcony, which she would catch. Laura used to spend the majority of her time sitting on her balcony. She would toss the flowers back to Gonzalo when he returned riding on his horse in the afternoon. They were madly in love. Laura's parents, on the other hand, desired that their daughter marry a wealthy local merchant.

Gonzalo got into a fight with that merchant one day. The merchant insulted Gonzalo while he was waiting to hear Laura's song beneath her window. During the fight, Gonzalo injured the merchant. Gonzalo fled from his hometown to Seville, then to Madrid, fearful of the consequences of a fight with a merchant. In fact, that merchant was well-known in the area. Following that, he made numerous attempts to contact Laura via letters, but all of his efforts were futile. He was unable to contact Laura after that. Laura's parents intercepted all of his letters. Laura did not receive a letter because of her parents.

Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo are now plotting their demise. They tell their stories about their deaths. The old Don Gonzalo claims to be the young man's cousin. According to him, the young Gonzalo had to leave his post because he had seriously injured the merchant. He enlisted in the army and traveled to Africa. He was killed in the battle and died in glory. The old Laura claims to know the woman known as 'The Silver Maiden,' and that she was her friend when she was younger.


She also lies about knowing the tragic story of her love affair with Gonzalo, a brave young man. The elderly lady reveals that her friend waited for Gonzalo for quite some time. She didn't get any information about him. She was seen leaving her house on the beach one afternoon. She scribbled Gonzalo's name in the sand and sat down on a rock, her gaze fixed on the horizon. She drowned in the sea after being swept out to sea by the waves.

Gonzalo had lost hope for Laura after three months of separation. Gonzalo absconded with a ballet dancer and married her in Paris. He began to live his family life. Laura, on the other hand, married after a two-year separation.


They are both aware that they are lying, but they pretend to be unaware. When they run into each other in the park after nearly 50 years, they both remember their passionate love affair. They conceal the truth, however, because they have moved on from their romantic past. At the end of the play, they agree to meet again at the park the next day if it is sunny.

      Understanding the text 

Answer the following questions.

a. What makes Dona Laura think that Don Gonzalo is an ill-natured man? Why do neither Dona Laura nor Don Gonzalo reveal their true identities?

➜ Gonzalo's rude behaviour, as well as his demeanour, lead Laura to believe that he is a bad-tempered man. Gonzalo frightens all the pigeons Laura is feeding breadcrumbs to in a park. He even responds to Laura's question in an impolite manner. Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo do not reveal their true identities because they are aware that they were lovers in the past. They are both quite old now and have outlived their youth. They believe that it is preferable to conceal their identities and to be happy through admirable words from both sides.



b. At what point of time, do you think, Laura and Gonzalo begin to recognise each other?

➜ When Dona Laura takes the book from Don Gonzalo and begins to read aloud, I believe Laura and Gonzalo begin to recognize each other. When she reads the line "Twenty Years Pass," they both look at each other with scepticism.


c. When does Dona Laura realise that Don Gonzalo was her former lover?

➜ When Dona Laura tells him about the villa in Maricella and Gonzalo tells her about the Silver Maiden named Laura Llorente, Dona Laura realizes that Don Gonzalo was her former lover. To hear his admirable description of her, she recognizes him as her former lover.



d. Why do Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo spin fictitious stories about themselves?

➜ Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo make up stories about themselves because they don't want to reveal their true identities to one another. They are now quite old and have moved on from their romantic past. They are dissatisfied with their ageing appearance. In this old age, they prefer to hear admirable words from one another. They believe it is better to interact with each other when they are unfamiliar with each other.



e. How do Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo feel about each other?

➜ Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo are irritated with each other at the start of the play. They lash out at each other with harsh and stinging words. However, when they establish a friendly relationship, they discover that they are former lovers. They begin telling their past stories while concealing their true identities. They don't want to reveal their reality at the age of seventy, preferring to reminisce about their happy romantic past through their conversations. They like each other and enjoy their admiration and past stories through fictitious means. They'd rather meet again in the park.

g. What is the effect of flashback in the play when Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo knew that they were the lovers in the past?

➜ A flashback is a dramatic device in which earlier events are interjected into a narrative's normal chronological flow. Flashback has played an important role in making this romantic comedy very interesting in this play. When Don Gonzalo and Dona Laura discovered that they had been lovers in the past, their flashback stories began to tell us about various events from their romantic youth. This play has been expanded with a variety of hidden facts as a result of their flashback. Because of its use, the play has a variety of concealing and revealing twists, as well as a satisfying climax. Both characters continue to use flashback stories with various information, which has made the entire audience pay attention and enjoy every single dialogue of the play. The foundation of this amusing play can be thought of as a flashback.



h. Discuss how the play is built around humour and irony.

➜ This play is built around irony and humour. The play is the ideal combination of humour and irony. This romantic comedy was created with the goal of entertaining all audiences through humour and irony. This play begins with old Dona Laura's amusing dialogue. Following Don Gonzalo's entrance into the park, the sarcastic arguments between both old people created an extremely humorous environment in the play. There's a lot of irony in both characters' pinching words. When they realize they know each other, they begin telling their flashback stories, which piques the readers' interest and makes them want to hear more from the characters. Their way of interacting with ironic remarks, their false stories about their deaths, their methods of concealing their identities to fool each other, their promise to meet the next sunny morning, and so on have added to the humour and irony of the play.


i. How is the title ‘A Sunny Morning’ justifiable? Discuss.

➜ This play is set in a park in Madrid, Spain on a sunny morning. In this setting, the entire play has been presented. A sunny morning has provided an ideal setting for a reunion of two former lovers in their golden years. They argue, know each other, conceal their identities, admire, tell fabricated stories about their deaths, prefer to meet again the next sunny morning, and so on. From start to finish, the entire play continues to make us laugh hysterically while remaining in this setting of a sunny morning. As a result, the title 'A Sunny Morning' is quite appropriate, as it depicts a reconciliation of former lovers in a park with great humour. In this way, the title ‘A Sunny Morning’ is justifiable.



 Reference beyond the text 

a. What do you predict will happen in the next meeting between Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo? Discuss.

➜ I predict they will be much more enthusiastic at the next meeting. They will once again express their emotions through fictitious means. They will both try to make each other happy. Don Gonzalo will undoubtedly be more forthright this time. He will make an effort to show his appreciation for her. Readers will be able to see their shyness. They will undoubtedly have a lot more fun with their pretentious acts.


b. Was it wise for Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo to keep their identities secret? How might their secrets affect future meetings?

➜ Yes, Dona Laura and Don were wise to keep their identities hidden. They both realized, at the age of seventy, that they were former lovers who had split up due to their misfortune. They did, however, a good job of concealing their true identities. They were both quite old and in poor physical condition. They were dissatisfied with their old appearance. The revelation of their true nature would be futile at this age. They reasoned that it would be best if they concealed their identities and pretended to be strangers. They decided that the best way to relive their sweet youthful memories was through deception. If they continue to lie in this manner, their secrets may have an impact on future meetings. Secrecy is never maintained for an extended period of time. Because of their older age, they are at a high risk of revealing secrets. If they unknowingly reveal their realities, they will not attempt to meet in the near future.

Frigyes Karinthy was a Hungarian satirist who lived from 1887 to 1938. He was an accomplished novelist, short story writer, poet, essayist, and playwright. He studied to be a teacher because he was deeply interested in natural sciences, but instead became a journalist and joined the literary periodical Nyugat. He was a strong philosophical and humanistic thinker who spoke out against the barbarism and horrors of World War I. His works, including That's How You Write (1912), Journey Around My Skull (1939), Please Sir (1916), and Professor, earned him widespread acclaim.

The play Refund, written in 1938, is about a man in his forties who returns to the school where he had studied and demands a refund of the fees he had paid eighteen years before, claiming that he had learned nothing useful at school and is now useless. Percival Wilde, an American playwright, adapted this play for a general audience. Refund highlights Karinthy's literary art's extraordinary sense of parody and wordplay. The play is full of humour and deals with a ridiculous situation.

Short Summary:
Wasserkopf, a former student, unexpectedly returns to his old school. He had gone there nearly eighteen years before. He enters the Principal's office with arrogance. He tells the Principal his name. He gives a negative response to the Principal's questions. He informs him of his failures and demands a refund of the tuition fees he paid for his education eighteen years ago. He believes he has not gotten his money's worth and knowledge from their education. He expresses his and his friend Leaderer's feelings about him. He demands a re-examination and threatens the Principle with a complaint to the education minister if his request is denied.

The Principal asks him to wait and convenes an emergency meeting of the masters. They have a serious discussion about the issue. The masters decide to give him the test and ask him simple questions. They decide to assist one another by declaring his incorrect answers correct.

1


Wasserkopf confronts each teacher one at a time. To irritate them, he refers to them as loafers. He calls them derogatory names and responds inanely. The teachers are pleased with his responses. He has been gifted with excellent patriarchal manners, gentlemanliness, courtesy, physical culture, alertness, perseverance, logic, and ambition.

His history professor asks him a simple question. "How long was the 'Thirty Years' War?" In his first question, he answers incorrectly as 'seven meters'. Through their reasonings, both the History and Mathematics masters prove his answer correct.

The Physics master then asks him a simple question about optical illusions. In response, Wasserkopf refers to the master as an ass. However, with proper reasoning, his answer is accepted as the correct answer. The Geography teacher asks him to say the capital city of Brunswick, a German province. The answer, according to Wasserkopf, is "Same." It is claimed by the masters to be the correct answer.


The Mathematics master then asks a meaningless question about the circumference of a polyhedron with 109° sides. Even the data used in the calculation is meaningless. According to Wasserkopf, the answer is 2629 litres. The master becomes enraged when he realizes his answer to a simple question is incorrect.


The master then instructs Wasserkopf to calculate the amount of fees to be refunded. He describes it as a difficult question. Wasserkopf computes the total and provides an exact answer.

Each teacher questions him and justifies his incorrect answers as correct, and they all give him high marks. Even though Wasserkopf gives incorrect answers and uses abusive language toward each master, they do not show their displeasure because they must prove him to be an excellent student to expel him. Finally, his masters declare him excellent and expel him from school.


Main Summary:
This amusing one-act play "Refund" was written in 1938 by a well-known Hungarian playwright named Frigyes Karinthy. Percival Wilde, an American playwright, adapted and translated this one-act play. This absurd and satirical play satirizes today's education system, which is quite backward in terms of preparing good students for the future. This play contains an extraordinary situation that has resulted in extreme humour.

The theme of this play is wit and unity. This play is about a former student of a school in Hungary named Wasserkopf who returns to his former school and demands a refund of the tuition fees he paid eighteen years ago, claiming that he learned nothing useful at school and is now useless. This play demonstrates teachers' excellent ability to manage the situation and deal with Wasserkopf without jeopardizing their school's reputation.

Wasserkof is a rude man who speaks in an abusive tone. He is unable to obtain employment. Even if he gets a job, he won't be able to keep it for long. People tell him that he is unfit for anything and hasn't learned anything worthwhile in school wherever he goes to apply for a job.


He once ran into an old classmate, Leaderer, on the street. When Leaderer discusses foreign exchange investment and the Hungarian currency with him, Wasserkopf expresses his inability to comprehend them. He begins to inquire about foreign exchange. Leaderer claims that if he doesn't know something as trivial as this, he hasn't learned anything in school. He advises him to return to his school and request a refund of his tuition fees.

Wasserkopf, who is unemployed and penniless, regards it as a good idea that will benefit him. So, after eighteen years, he returns to his old school and demands his tuition fees back, claiming he hasn't learned anything and that they haven't taught him anything worthwhile. After hearing such an absurd demand, the principal is taken aback. Wasserkopf has even threatened to go to the education minister if he is not given justice. He demands a re-examination and demands his money back if he fails. The principal becomes perplexed and finds himself in an unusual situation, so he calls an urgent meeting of all the masters.

They decide to re-examine him and agree to prove his answers, whether correct or incorrect, correct. They realize that Wasserkopf will purposefully fail the exam by giving incorrect answers to receive a refund from the school. As a result, the entire staff decides to outwit him and work together to help each other. Wasserkopf uses abusive and derogatory language toward each master to be expelled from school. However, the masters outwit him by demonstrating his superiority in Manners, Physical Culture, Alertness, Perseverance, Logic, and Ambition.


The history teacher politely asks him to take a seat, but his response enrages the teacher. The master waits patiently and begins his question. The first question he asks is how long the 'Thirty Years War' lasted. The answer is whispered loudly by the physics master, and the geography master shows his ten fingers three times. Even though the answer is contained within the question, Waaserkopf is eager to provide a false answer and claims that the war lasted seven meters. All of the teachers become paralyzed. When the history master is unable to prove his incorrect answer, the mathematics master steps in.

He claims that years can be represented in terms of meters by Einstein's relativity theory and that the actual war lasted only seven years. Because the war lasted only one day (twelve hours), it lasted 15 years. The master subtracts three hours per day for combatants' eating from 15 years, reducing 15 years to 12 years. He subtracts several hours for midday siestas, peaceful diversions, and non-warlike activities. He finally reaches the age of seven and wipes his brow. As a result, the candidate's answer of seven meters is correct in Einstein's equivalence of seven meters.

The physics master then inquires about the clocks in the steeples of the churches. He wonders if it's because of the optical illusion that the church's clock shrinks when someone walks away from it. In response, Wasserkopf refers to the master as an ass. However, the master accepts the answer as correct. The reason given is that an ass has no imaginative abilities because it is a sad creature. The master claims that it must be an optical illusion, and Wasserkopf responds metaphorically.


The geography teacher then asks him to name the capital city of the same name Brunswick, a German province. Wasserkopf, on the other hand, responds with the word 'same.' The master proves his correct answer by claiming that the city also has another name, 'Same.' According to legend, the emperor Barbarossa was riding through the city when he met a peasant girl. After wishing her a "God Bless You," he inquired as to the name of the city. While munching on a bun, the girl replied, "Same to you, sir." The emperor, however, mistook the city name for 'Same.' As a result, masters rate Wasserkopf highly in geography. Finally, the mathematics master approaches him to ask him a question. He declares that he is going to ask Wasserkopf two questions, one easy and one difficult.

First, he asks him a simple question about the circumference of a 109° sided polyhedron, but the data is irrelevant for the calculation. Wasserkopf provides an incorrect response. The math teacher becomes enraged and declares that his answer is incorrect. So he tells Wasserkopf that he is entitled to a tuition refund. Then he asks for the exact amount he needs. Wasserkopf tells them the exact total is 5682 crowns and 38 hellers, and the grand total is 6450 crowns and 50 hellers, oblivious to the teachers' trap. At this point, the mathematics master declares his correct answer to his difficult question. All of his answers are correct, according to all of his teachers. They give him honours in all subjects and expel him from school.""",

 Reference beyond the text 

a. The play is a satire on the present day education system. Do you think that our education system does not prepare students for life? Discuss.

➜ Yes, I believe that our educational system does not adequately prepare students for life. The current educational system is disconnected from the concept of practical life. It has nothing to do with a practical way of life. It has diverted people's attention away from creativity and rendered them impractical. In today's world, there are many educated people with high certificate values who have no knowledge of anything. They don't even have the ability to guide others. As a result, the current educational system is producing ineffective workers in a variety of industries.



b. Our education system focuses on memorisation rather than creative thinking. Do you think the knowledge imparted by education may not have practical relevance in one’s day-to-day life? Who do you blame for this?

➜ Yes, I believe that the knowledge imparted by education may not be practical in daily life. We find education and its related knowledge far away from creative thinking in the context of the present system of education. The education courses are designed in such a way that they are unrelated to practical relevance in daily life. These educational materials have no application in real life. People who are struggling in academic fields are also looking for an easy way to memorize rather than creative thinking. The majority of students are on the wrong track, focusing solely on passing exams and receiving certificates. For them, creativity has no place in their lives. They are only concerned with obtaining excellent certificates through various means. This is directly attributable to the current educational system, which has corrupted thousands of minds.


c. Most of the students want to learn just for examination rather than knowledge. Do you think that certificate will help them in their future career?

➜ No, I do not believe that the certificate will benefit students in their future careers. At the moment, the majority of students are on the wrong track. Their preparation for the exam has a time limit. They are seen a lot more frequently before two or three months of their examination. They are far from the concept of knowledge, but they believe in quick fixes to pass their exams. The method they've chosen to pass their exam isn't good for their future. Because certificates never reveal true knowledge or talent, they will undoubtedly face a lack of authentic knowledge in the future. Most students nowadays obtain certificates through dubious means as well. """
